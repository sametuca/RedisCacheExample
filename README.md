# What is REDÄ°S
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It is often referred to as a data structure server because it allows users to store, access, and manipulate data structures such as lists, sets, and hashes in memory. Redis can also be used as a message broker, caching layer, and database.

Redis is designed to be very fast and scalable, with a small memory footprint. It achieves this by keeping all data in memory and persisting it to disk periodically or on-demand. Redis also supports a wide range of data structures, making it a versatile tool for many different use cases.

Redis can be used in a variety of applications, including real-time analytics, caching, session management, and message queuing. It has become popular in recent years due to its speed and flexibility, and is widely used in many large-scale web applications.
